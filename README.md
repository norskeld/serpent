Yet another TypeScript library starter with conventional goodies and automatic semantic releases.

## Usage

Create your own repo [using this one as a template][use-template], clone it, [make necessary changes](#edits), install dependencies and you are set.

## Features

What's inside:

- **[TypeScript]** with **[tsup]** for bundling (CJS/ESM) and **[tsx]** (for executing `.ts` files).
- **[Vitest]**: for testing and generating coverage report, by default it runs in watch mode (behaves properly in CI).
- **[ESLint]**: with TypeScript and Prettier plugins, extends only built-in recommended configs.
- **[Prettier]**: very basic config, feel free to adjust as you want.
- **[commitlint]**: for linting commits, by default it uses [Angular preset][commitlint-preset].
- **[semantic-release]**: for generating `CHANGELOG.md` and [handling the whole releasing process][semantic-release-highlights] based on [conventional commits][cc].
- **[husky]** + **[lint-staged]**: for fixing and formatting your code before committing.
- **[EditorConfig]**: handy little thing to make things a bit more consistent.

Also:

- **[.vscode](.vscode)**: some handy settings for Visual Studio Code.
- **[.scripts/release](.scripts/release.ts)**: custom script to help **semantic-release** produce flat and tidy tarballs.
- **[.github/workflows](.github/workflows)**: basic configs for:
  - Testing and building on **node@16**;
  - Releasing to **npm** with **semantic-release**.

## Edits

You'll have to make some changes right after generating your own repository using this template.

- **[README.md](README.md)**: change as you want, you may want to check [this site][readme] and [this awesome-readme list][readme-awesome] for examples of good readmes.
- **[LICENSE](LICENSE)**: change as you want and don't forget to mention it in README.
- **[package.json](package.json)**: change `name`, `description`, `repository.url`, `keywords`, `author`, `bugs.url`, `homepage`.
- **[.github/workflows](.github/workflows)**: either remove these, replace with your own CI configuration or change as you need.
  - [semantic-release has recipes and instructions][semantic-recipes] for popular CI services.

## License

[MIT](LICENSE) by default, but you may want to [consider using something else][choose-license].
